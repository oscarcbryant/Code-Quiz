# Code-Quiz
This repository hosts a mini quiz we are creating in week 4 of coding bootcamp

The purpose of this exercise was to generate a quiz so we can practice our knowledge in using javascript with in built API's. 
The inbuilt API's we used were event listeners, saving to local storage and setinterval (countdown timer.)

## What did we learn

We learnt about applying html through js to ensure pages could be updated dynamically after an event (in this case, 'click'.)
We learnt about the significance of calling and declaring functions when we want them to apply.


## Challenges faced

We faced challenges in ensuring the timing loop was applied to the correct function. 
The timing loop would load when we opened the page so we needed to insert it into a broader function (in this case, buttonCallBack) to see it created.

We also had issues in generating buttons for quiz however, we learnt through the process that this could be generated through using Javascript to write and call html code. 

We also learnt a lot about structure... as soon as we have structure to our pages, it becomes easier to replicate the code we are looking to write. 

## conclusion

In future, we'll look to apply structure to our code, and map out what we want our pages to look like prior to writing any code. This will help us visualise what we are trying to do, and create a better position to approach our code from.
